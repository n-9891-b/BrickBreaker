# BrickBreaker
  Working project - Not all functionality has yet been added.
## About Project
  I created this project to display my abilities using Canvas. The goal was to build off of a common Canvas block breaking game and add more complexity to it. The intension in this project was test and solidify my abilities using Javascript without the use of additional frameworks or libraries. I kept a similar intension in mind when adding styling to game. Thus, although the means of adding functionality through the use of pure Javascript seems tedious and longhanded, and the styling theme in some ways does not match (i.e. the styling of the custom popups compared to the styling of the ingame experience), the target was to test my strengths with the basics.    
## Languages Used
   * HTML
   * CSS
   * Javascript

## Functionality
The following is a basic outline of the main functionality written into BrickBreaker using Javascript.

1. Prompt for name, provide user choice, show instructions, start game.
2. Balls bouce off walls as well as other balls and paddle on impact.
3. Paddle is moved using left and right arrow keys as well as the mouse pad.
4. Bricks disappear when ball hits, ball moves in opposite direction, new brick is generated in random postion with random size and color, score is incremented.
5. If playing with multiple balls has been chosen, new ball is generated when given score is reached.
6. Game is won if end score is reach.
7. Game is lost if ball(s) hits the bottom of the canvas.
  
##Cases still needing resolution
1. Prevent new ball from appearing in same place as other balls.
2. Fix ball direction when bouncing off of each other.
3. Fix if brick has similar color to background, change the brick color.
4. Add lives feature.
5. Add multi-level feature.
6. Add choose theme feature.
